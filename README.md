# Maternal Mortality in the US Data Project

## Overview

This project explores trends and disparities in maternal mortality using data from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** and the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. It highlights key patterns, causes, and inequalities in maternal health outcomes—especially in the United States—through data analysis and visual storytelling.

## Data Sources

* **Dr. Sheila Marcus**, a psychiatrist and Medical Director at Michigan Clinical Consultations & Care, who provided context on the rising impact of mental health conditions in maternal deaths.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

  * Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Datawrapper**: For creating interactive, embeddable charts
* **Adobe Illustrator**: Used to design custom static graphics
* **ai2html**: Converts Illustrator charts into responsive HTML for mobile-friendly publishing

## Features

* Analysis of maternal death trends over time
* Visual breakdowns by race, cause of death, and postpartum timing
* U.S. vs. global maternal mortality comparison
* Mobile-responsive data visualizations
* Integration of expert interviews and external reporting

## Visual Assets

* **Illustrative photo** used in the project is by **Jozemara Friorili Lemes**, sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).
