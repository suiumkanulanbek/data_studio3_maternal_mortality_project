            <p>The United States has been facing a serious problem with maternal health, as it has one of the highest rates of maternal
                deaths among wealthy countries. According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
                there were 18.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023. While this number has decreased from 22.3 deaths per 100,000 in 2022, 
                it still puts the U.S. in a troubling position compared to other high-income nations.</p>

            <p>Recent data shows a decline in maternal death rates in the U.S., but <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434867/">the COVID-19 pandemic 
                has reshaped the risks</a> mothers face.</p>
                  
            <p>In 2020, mental health conditions became the leading cause of maternal deaths,
                replacing cardiovascular issues and hemorrhage, which were the top causes before the pandemic. 
                This shift has been significant, with nearly one in four maternal deaths linked to mental health struggles. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The CDC defines mental health-related maternal deaths broadly, including suicides, overdoses, 
                and poisonings tied to substance use disorders. It also covers other deaths that Maternal
                Mortality Review Committees link to mental health issues, including substance use disorders.</p>

            <p>Tragically, about 83.5% of maternal deaths were preventable. 
                In a country like the U.S., which spends billions on healthcare, this highlights serious gaps in the system.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Black women are disproportionately affected, facing a much higher risk of 
                maternal death. In 2023, their mortality rate was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 
                live births—more than three times that of White women. This stark disparity 
                underscores long-standing inequalities in healthcare access and quality for minority communities.</p>

            <p>Harvard health policy expert Alecia McGregor warns that, along with healthcare 
                disparities affecting women of color, many hospitals are shutting down obstetric 
                units across the U.S.</p>

            <p>“Every year, more hospital obstetric units close, and it’s no surprise that these closures 
                are hitting communities of color the hardest, given the backdrop of racial residential segregation,” she said.</p>

            <p>McGregor also pointed to a report from the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center, which 
                found that nearly 60% of rural counties have no hospital obstetric services.</p>

            <p>As the nation faces these challenges, tackling healthcare inequalities, improving access to quality care, and focusing
                on preventing deaths remain crucial in protecting maternal health in all communities.</p>
